    As the sun dipped below the horizon, leaving the world cloaked in shadows, our tale takes an unexpected turn. Sometimes, stories remain unfinished, and mysteries linger in the unsolved. Perhaps another time, another place, 
    the narrative will find its completion. For now, the pages of this adventure close prematurely, leaving the conclusion untold. Farewell, 
    brave reader, and let the untold secrets rest in the realm of imagination.<br>
